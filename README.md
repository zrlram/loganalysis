Log Analysis Scripts (afterglow/src/perl/loganalysis)
--------------------

random_logs.pl		The tool takes two files and chooses entries from each
	 		to make up random combinations
			Currently an exponentiation algorithm is used to compute bias
merge_logs.pl 		The tool takes two files. The first one defines a 
		 	lookup table. The second one is a CSV file. If a value
 			from the lookup table shows up in the second file, 
 			a third column is appended with the 'value' field
 			from the lookup file
anonymize.pl		Anonymizes log entries
